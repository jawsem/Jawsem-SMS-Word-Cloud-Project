## SMS Word Cloud Project

**For this project the original goal was to extract text data out of an XML file and then use it to create word clouds.**

**First I extracted all my text data from my android form into an XML file.  I used my BeutifulSoup to parse the data into a dataframe and then did a little analysis on the number of 
texts that were sent to my contacts over the past 2 years.**

**Then I took some of my pictures from my Wedding and created some functions to project word clouds around the images**

**It made for a nice little gift to my wife as I ended up using some that code to project a word cloud of our Wedding Vows around some images and gave them to her for her birthday**

**Note: Although this contains the function I used the notebook is not complete, I was getting errors saving it because my notebook was too large.**

**To do for a later date is creating a breaking it up into multiple notebooks or not displaying as many images**
